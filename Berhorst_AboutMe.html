          <figcaption class="figure-caption">My name is Tate Berhorst. I am a full-blooded Korean, although my last name says otherwise. My last name was adopted, as my father, Steve Berhorst, was adopted. I am always excited to do new things, and I have well-rounded skills.

            <p>At this time, I am a student currently attending Dublin High School. I have a interest in the cultinary field, and I am interested in this particular field because I find enjoyment in a busy environment involving food and dishes. Through this opportunity, I hope to improve both my management with a team or a group of people. I also hope to improve my culinary skills in general, whether it be setting a table or cooking the dish itself. Because of this passion, I am determined to let this grow the skills necessary so I can enter the medical or technological field.
                <br>
            For this, I need all of the skills in which I had listed above. As of now, I am adept at all of them because of the social and connective environment I was raised in. I have adequate speaking skills, which I have used many times in my academic life for speeches and presentations.
                <br>
            During my life, I have been dedicated to the piano for over 5 years. I also spend lots of time practicing lacrosse whenever the sports season comes around, and I attend all known practices From these I learned dedication, sticking with something even if I have a rough time because later I would become much more skilled. Outside of school, I like to communicate with friends and give favors, as well as find ways to spend as much time with friends as possible.
                <br>
           To finish this off, I am intrigued to work in the medical field because of my passion for the attributes it brings about. I am also interested in technology, as my father is in the field and I would like to join him in the future. However, the first step would be to learn basic working skills. This will allow me to gain the skills needed in the medical field.
